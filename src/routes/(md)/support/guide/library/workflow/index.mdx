# Shabad OS Library workflow

This guide will outline a basic workflow for dewarping a set of images. You don't have to do every step exactly as described and you may include other steps in your process. The steps are also not perfectly linear and can be done in order of personal preference.

## Step 1: Open the folder of images

Click "Open Directory" in Shabad OS Library and point it to the folder containing the set of images to be used for dewarping. This will add all compatible images to the sidebar.

## Step 2: Measure your media

Look through your set of images to get an idea of where the four points of a quadrilateral will be placed and then physically measure the width and height to get your page ratio (width ÷ height = page ratio). Be sure to use this measurement to set the page ratio. Change the number and click "Set Page Ratio".

## Step 3: Create a quadrilateral and preview it

Choose an image file from the sidebar. Either left or right click on the image four times to create a quadrilateral shape. Points can be dragged for adjustment.

Click the "Preview" button at the bottom to see what the dewarping process will output. The preview is a quick calculation and produces a blurrier image than what will actually be outputted by the deskew program.

It is also possible to import the quadrilateral points for images. If a dataset exists, click the "Import" button to ingest it. The import matches the file names in the side bar with the dataset.

## Step 4: Export your data

Exporting is similar to saving your work for later use. The exported file will contain the page ratio and quadrilateral coordinates for images currently open in the sidebar. Shabad OS Library keeps a cache of saved data between sessions, so it is not necessary to export data simply to save it for later. Rather it is expected to export data when switching folders of images or collaborating on the same set of files with other people.

After exporting, the app will ask if you want to delete any saved/cached information pertaining to files and their quadrilateral coordinates. If you're going to be exporting as a means to save your work periodically, you may ignore deleting this information. If you've finished up with a folder of images and plan to work on a new set of files, it would be wise to clear the data after a final export. Click "Export" to save your data into a file. The best place to put this file would be the currently open directory, alongside the images you just worked on. If you ever come back to a directory of files, you may click "Import" and view the page ratio and quadrilateral coordinates again.
