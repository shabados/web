# Get started with Shabad OS Library

Shabad OS Library is a work in progress, and is not the easiest program to run on your computer.

## Self-compile

As of writing, the only way to use the Shabad OS Library is via CLI (command-line interface). You must have node.js and npm installed as well.

- Clone the [library repo on GitHub](https://github.com/shabados/library)
- `npm i`
- run locally with `npm run dev` or build for your platform (e.g. `npm run build:mac`)

## Future

A lot of features used in Shabad OS Library require a browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. The Electron bundler makes it so that it will always work on the user's machine. It is possible that in the future we will release downloadable builds or even host it online and check for the user's browser type.
