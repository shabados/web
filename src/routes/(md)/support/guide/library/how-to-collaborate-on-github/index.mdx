# How to collaborate on GitHub for Shabad OS Library

Working together, people can help deskew important works of art including gurbani steeks, gurmukhi dictionaries, and other related sikh panthic texts.

## Have a GitHub Account

It is not possible to collaborate on GitHub without an account.

[Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join)

## Communicate which files to work on

It is recommended to reach out to the Shabad OS community to get an idea of where to get the files to work on, where to import the current dataset for it, and how to share the exported file. By participating, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct, the [Contributor Covenant](/docs/community/code-of-conduct).

## Generic ways to collaborate on GitHub

There are two recommended approaches (in order of easier to harder):

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/shabados/library/issues/new) (if prompted, choose "Task") and attach the `files.json` to that by dragging & dropping, selecting, or pasting it into the "Leave a comment" box. Be sure to note which set of images the file applies to.
- [Open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your `files.json` in the correct folder (e.g. `/library/mahan kosh/files.json`)
