# What is Shabad OS Library?

The Shabad OS Library enables users to dewarp images by referencing the points of a quadrilateral. It is designed to create a better database and improve the proofreading workflow.

## Purpose

Using Shabad OS Library, we are able to save dewarping data points for images. After dewarping images, they can be bound together into a neatly organized PDF. Each image file will run through an Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning program that reads the characters. This information will be used in the Shabad OS Database to ensure the highest integrity of data when dealing with the digitization of Gurbani, Sikh Bani, and other Panthic texts.

## Audience

The intended user of Shabad OS Library is a technical person that can decently view angles/proportions and line things up with the naked eye. To properly use Shabad OS Library, one has to be able to pick the correct quadrilateral points to dewarp an image into a flat rectangle. With appropriate training, most everyone should be able to use the app. The app not intended to consume media, but rather a preprocessing step in a larger workflow. So users will more than likely be using the app to process scans of bound pages.
