# Open images and import data in Shabad OS Library

This guide will visually show how to open a directory of images and how to import page ratio and quadrilateral coordinates.

## Open a folder of images

1. Click "Open Directory" in the controls area top left.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-interface.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library onscreen preview'
  link={true}
/>

2. Choose your folder

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-folder-picker.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library folder picker'
  link={true}
/>

3. See files open in the left sidebar. Click any file to view it on the right side.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-file-clean.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library initial file preview'
  link={true}
/>

## Import your data

1. Click "Import" in the controls area top left. Then choose the file to import and open it.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-import-file.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library importing a file'
  link={true}
/>

2. If the current image has new data, the program will ask you to refresh the current view. Click on the current image from the sidebar to refresh it.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-refresh-image.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library file prompt to refresh image'
  link={true}
/>

3. Note that after importing data and refreshing the image, that the page ratio and quadrilateral coordinates are applied to the current project's workspace.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-interface-onscreen-preview.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library file prompt to refresh image'
  link={true}
/>
