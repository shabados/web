# Save and Export data in Shabad OS Library

This guide will visually show how to save the page ratio and quadrilateral coordinates for a directory of images. The exported file can be used to import the saved data.

## Export your data

1. Click "Export" in the controls area top left.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-interface-onscreen-preview.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library onscreen preview'
  link={true}
/>

2. Choose the folder to save your exported `files.json` file. It is recommended to co-locate your exported file in the same directory as the images. If any existing `files.json` is found, it will ask to over-write the saved information with the currently exported data.

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-export-file-overwrite.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library ask to overwrite exported files.json'
  link={true}
/>

## Decide whether to delete local storage

Shabad OS Library automatically saves page ratio and quadrilateral coordinates between sessions. This is to avoid unnecessary exporting when working on a single project at a time. If you're ready to move on to a new set of images, it is recommended to wipe the locally cached data to avoid file name conflicts in a new project. If you're exporting as a means of collaborating with someone else, but want to continue working on the same set of images, then you should ignore the prompt to delete local storage.

Choose whether or not to keep the cached data in Shabad OS Library:

<Media
  src='/media/shabad-os-library-delete-local-storage-prompt.png'
  alt='Shabad OS library ask to overwrite exported files.json'
  link={true}
/>

If you choose to remove the cached data, you will be presented with the initial interface with the page ratio reset.
